Capo 2nd

E            G        D      A
There exists place in all of us
E           G        D       A
So close we touch it now
E                   G
A darkened grove of saplings
      D                      A
We've watched our lives grow tall
       


       E             G  
Though sun has never touched it
     D                A
It's darkness doesn't fright
    E                G
The trees surround a clearing
D                 A
Grounding lest we fall

E               G
When we sit and listen
       D                A
To the song of creaking wood
   E                   G
We see the stars still pierce the sky
      D             A
Their distant fires call


CHORUS

        D.              A
For this space is not a dungeon
      G                 E
But a place to rest our soul
         D.               A
From the starkness of the daylight
        G.       C.         E#
And the lives in which we're small
