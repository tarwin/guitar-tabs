5th fret ?

Em         G
Sitting in the sand
D                     A
On the west coast of sf
Watching the waves break
And the Seagulls overhead

People walking up and down
They smile and wave at me
Not sure what they're thinking
Coz there ain't a lot see

Fog's rolled in and all I've got
Is Karl's warm embrace
Looking for the faralons
and seeing empty space

Sitting on a shitty beach
On the west coast of sf
People think it's beautiful
I think its fucking cold and wet

What was I thinking
Leaving it all behind
The beauty of St Kilda beaches
Tanned and taught hides

Evenings in halfmoon bay
Lovers in the waves
There was dreams of futures
Even if they were lame

They've both got trams
Out on to the sand
Theme parks here are dead forever
Sad song from the band

And I'm ...

Sitting on a shitty beach
On the west coast of sf
People think it's beautiful
I think its fucking cold and wet

I guess it's got it's magic
Like my life it's changed a lot
Sitting around a fire burning
New friends that I have got

And there's the rushing sound
of wind over waves
And a lack of People telling you
to stay between the flags


I guess it's not all the bad
but I'm still gonna complain
about sitting on this freezing
beach on the westcosat in the rain

And I'm ...

Sitting on a sandy beach
Thinking about life's plans
It really is quite beautiful
I've become quite a fan
