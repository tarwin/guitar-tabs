Mozzies in the shed

Bm        Em
It's been 40 years
Am          D
Cleaning up the shed

Em            D
And every box I move
G            D
Is closer to the end

Each of them is full
Of memories and ants

And as the sun is setting
The mozzies come a' dance

Am          D
It's mozzie time
It's mozzie time
It's mozzie time
It's mozzie time
It's mozzie time
It's mozzie time
