D                     G
The speed of light is infinite
Em               A
Within it all is bound
    D               Em
All butterflies and crocodiles
G                   A
Exist as if they're sound

D                    G
The contents of each tiny brick
Em               A
Of matter can be found
   D              Em
Or lost among the early 'verse
      G            A
Split 'part become background

[CHORUS] =

C               A          Em
This is what we understand to be
D                 C        ASus?
Everything that's possible to see
C               A             Em
Stars above and earth below us
D                C        ASus
Such a wondrous possibility

D             G
Formed in to a lump, or two
    Em              A
And slowly they are bound
  D                Em
A star ignites and then ablaze
     G                A
Four bonds for lifes' compound

D            G
Spirals in a fractal haze
    Em               A
All circles, orbits, round and round
D                 Em
Colliding nuggets falling in
G                    A
At last we are earth bound

[CHORUS] =

C               A          Em
This is what we understand to be
D                 C        A
Everything that's possible to see
C               A             Em
Stars above and earth below us
D                C        A
Such a wondrous possibility

---

Misty clouds rain down upon
The barest rock that can be found
Polymeric fighting feuds
Only winners will be crowned

Vibrations stir these muddy pools
The start of something new around
One stops the second rule quite dead
Complexity fights back, rewound

Green acres reach across
Each spit upon the ground
Another step towards the truth
Sun soaked engines do abound

Poisonous gases spew on out
A nest once more a breeding-ground
For faster and more hungry beasts
Large herds of gnashing hounds

[Chorus Again]

Two handed standing tall
Paths merged deep underground
We become creators all
Witness, master, the profound

    D               Em
All butterflies and crocodiles
G                   D
Exist as if they're sound
